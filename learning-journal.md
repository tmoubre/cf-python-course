# Learning Journal â€” Exercise 1.1

## What I set up
- Installed Python 3.8.7 on Windows and verified pip.
- Configured PATH so the correct Python is used.
- Installed and used `virtualenvwrapper-win` to manage environments.
- Created a virtual environment (`cf-python-base`).
- Built a simple script (`add.py`) that adds two numbers entered by the user.
- Installed IPython and explored its interactive shell.
- Generated a `requirements.txt` file using `pip freeze`.
- Created a second environment (`cf-python-copy`) and installed dependencies from `requirements.txt`.

## What I learned
- How to create and manage virtual environments on Windows using `workon` and `deactivate`.
- How to write and run a simple Python program from the command line.
- How to install packages into a virtual environment with pip.
- How to capture dependencies in `requirements.txt` and rebuild the same environment elsewhere.
- The importance of PATH order in Windows when working with multiple `python.exe` locations.

## What I want to learn next
- How to organize larger Python projects with multiple modules.
- How to write unit tests with `pytest`.
- How to use tools like `black` and `flake8` for consistent code style.
- How to publish projects to GitHub with a clean workflow.
