# Exercise 1.1 — Getting Started with Python

## Contents
- `add.py` — a script that asks the user for two numbers and prints their sum.
- `requirements.txt` — package list captured from the `cf-python-base` environment.
- `learning-journal.md` — reflections on what was learned during the exercise.
- `screenshots/` — screenshots of each step (Python version, env activation, running script, IPython, requirements, etc.).

## Steps Completed
1. Installed Python 3.8.7 and pip.
2. Created virtual environment `cf-python-base`.
3. Wrote and executed `add.py`.
4. Installed IPython inside `cf-python-base` and verified it runs.
5. Exported environment dependencies to `requirements.txt`.
6. Created a new virtual environment `cf-python-copy` and re-installed dependencies from `requirements.txt`.
7. Uploaded deliverables to GitHub.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repo and open the `Exercise-1.1` folder.
2. Create and activate a virtual environment (example with built-in venv):
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   # On Windows (cmd):
   .venv\Scripts\activate
   # On Windows (PowerShell):
   .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
